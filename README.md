# MS_SQL_Server_Project
---

In this project, I first installed VMware virtual machine on my computer and then Windows 2016 in order to avoid compatibility problems between SQL Server and the operating system.
Then I installed Microsoft SQL Server 2017 Developer Edition and Management Studio on the virtual machine.
### Creating a Database with MS SQL Server:
 * #### I created a database from ziro by fallowing:
   * Drafting a relational database through Google sheets
   * Creating the syntax for the tables in the draft,
   * Creating tables with sql queries from these syntaxes
   * And adding some random variables to the tables via sql query
### Querying and Analyzing  an Existing Database:

   * Customers and order information
   * Total order quantity by city
   * Order distribution by product category
   * Order distribution by date
   * Order distribution by payment method
   * Average delivery time
   * Subquery examples
